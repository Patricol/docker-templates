<Beta>, <Category> (Both optional but highly recommended).  These entries are created by this plugin: http://lime-technology.com/forum/index.php?topic=40111.0  unRaid 6.2+ includes these tags in the generated XML

<Date> This entry contains the date the container has been created and/or updated http://lime-technology.com/forum/index.php?topic=40111.msg381735#msg381735

<Changes> This entry contains a changelog for the container.  http://lime-technology.com/forum/index.php?topic=40111.msg379576#msg379576

<Project> The entry contains a url to the project page (home page) for the container (eg: https://plex.tv)  http://lime-technology.com/forum/index.php?topic=40299.msg394762#msg394762

<Licence> or <License>  Optionally displays licence information for the app  http://lime-technology.com/forum/index.php?topic=40262.msg444243#msg444243

<BaseImage> this is a text field for what the base image of the container is.  Note that if the application feed is able to scrape the actual base image used from dockerHub, that result will override this one

<Branch> (docker app only) will allow CA to ask the user which branch of the application to install.  See here: http://lime-technology.com/forum/index.php?topic=40299.msg495429#msg495429

 

 

Additionally, CA supports placing an optional donate button at the bottom of the popup changelogs and full descriptions.  The tags associated with this are:

 

<DonateText> A short blurb of why to donate (eg: Server's Cost Money, I'm paying for a divorce, I'm out of beer, etc

<DonateLink> A link to take you to the actual website where the donations are handled

<DonateImg> A link to the image to display for the link (eg: paypal's Donate Button).  The image can be any size, but is automatically resized to be 25px high (about 50% of paypal's image with the CC info at the bottom)

 

NOTE that & are disallowed in entries.  You will need to replace them with this: &amp; Failure to do this will result in your application not displaying within CA (And not being able to be installed via dockerMan

 

<DonateText> is optional, but both <DonateLink> and <DonateImg> are mandatory for this to appear (One or the other missing will result in the button not appearing)

 

 

Side Note

 

Only the tags which are listed in this thread (and the companion PluginXML thead)are official / semi-official / unofficial.  If you happen to look at the XML's which are generated by CA and passed through to dockerMan at installation, there are many other tags that are contained within that are utilized only for CA's internal purposes.  Do not utilize them.
