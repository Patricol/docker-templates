# docker-templates

A selection of templates to be used with Unraid.

These allow docker containers to be more conveniently added to an Unraid server.

Many of these are for containers of my own creation. Many more are for others' containers that were missing templates. Some are for containers whose existing templates' default settings caused problems during updates.
