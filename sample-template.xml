EDIT: It looks like all/most of the links within this post are not functional.  However, they would all either link to another post within this thread or to a post within the Application Categorizer plugin support thread or to a post within CA.  Reply to this thread if you have any questions about the optional tags.

 

CA relies upon a third party parser and hosting of the template author's xml files that is out of the author of CAs control. Because of this, the only supported XML format is that which is generated by unRaid's docker tab when hitting SAVE on the template. Any manual editing of the XML files may present compatibility issues for CA and if they turn out to be incompatible, will result in the template being blacklisted within CA until brought into conformity with the dockerMan generated files. As an example, the extra spacing on the various﻿ Config﻿ element attributes﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ is incompatible with the third party parser﻿ and will result in either ﻿errors or incorrect﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ entries being made when adding the container through CA. dockerMan﻿ ﻿﻿does﻿ not generate﻿ the﻿﻿ extra spacing as listed﻿ belo﻿﻿﻿w, an﻿d CA﻿﻿﻿ h﻿as no ﻿﻿problem﻿﻿ w﻿ith﻿﻿ d﻿oc﻿kerMan's﻿﻿﻿ gene﻿rate﻿d﻿ ﻿fi﻿les.

With the changes to the docker template XML being introduced by the Community Repositories and Community Applications plugins, I figured that those changes should be documented somewhere rather than being buried in various threads.

 

The official XML (as generated by dockerMan) is as follows:  (probably described somewhere in this thread: http://lime-technology.com/forum/index.php?topic=33965.0 - TLDR﻿

<!--
Note that for CA / Apps Tab, either <Description> or <Overview> must be present and not empty.  IE: Its required.

 

Additionally, there are also some (currently) unofficial entries.

 

<Support> Contains a link to a support thread for the container.  http://lime-technology.com/forum/index.php?topic=39106.msg365627#msg365627 

<Overview> Contains a condensed description for the container (basically the same thing as the description, but without any formatting or instructions  http://lime-technology.com/forum/index.php?topic=39106.msg365627#msg365627  unRaid 6.2+ generates this tag instead of the <Description> tag

<Beta>, <Category> (Both optional but highly recommended).  These entries are created by this plugin: http://lime-technology.com/forum/index.php?topic=40111.0  unRaid 6.2+ includes these tags in the generated XML

<Date> This entry contains the date the container has been created and/or updated http://lime-technology.com/forum/index.php?topic=40111.msg381735#msg381735

<Changes> This entry contains a changelog for the container.  http://lime-technology.com/forum/index.php?topic=40111.msg379576#msg379576

<Project> The entry contains a url to the project page (home page) for the container (eg: https://plex.tv)  http://lime-technology.com/forum/index.php?topic=40299.msg394762#msg394762

<Licence> or <License>  Optionally displays licence information for the app  http://lime-technology.com/forum/index.php?topic=40262.msg444243#msg444243

<BaseImage> this is a text field for what the base image of the container is.  Note that if the application feed is able to scrape the actual base image used from dockerHub, that result will override this one

<Branch> (docker app only) will allow CA to ask the user which branch of the application to install.  See here: http://lime-technology.com/forum/index.php?topic=40299.msg495429#msg495429

 

 

Additionally, CA supports placing an optional donate button at the bottom of the popup changelogs and full descriptions.  The tags associated with this are:

 

<DonateText> A short blurb of why to donate (eg: Server's Cost Money, I'm paying for a divorce, I'm out of beer, etc

<DonateLink> A link to take you to the actual website where the donations are handled

<DonateImg> A link to the image to display for the link (eg: paypal's Donate Button).  The image can be any size, but is automatically resized to be 25px high (about 50% of paypal's image with the CC info at the bottom)

 

NOTE that & are disallowed in entries.  You will need to replace them with this: &amp; Failure to do this will result in your application not displaying within CA (And not being able to be installed via dockerMan

 

<DonateText> is optional, but both <DonateLink> and <DonateImg> are mandatory for this to appear (One or the other missing will result in the button not appearing)

 

 

Side Note

 

Only the tags which are listed in this thread (and the companion PluginXML thead)are official / semi-official / unofficial.  If you happen to look at the XML's which are generated by CA and passed through to dockerMan at installation, there are many other tags that are contained within that are utilized only for CA's internal purposes.  Do not utilize them.
